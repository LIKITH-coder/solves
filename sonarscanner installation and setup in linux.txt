Sonar Scanner Setup:
1) Installation

IN SERVER >>>>
   cd /opt/
   wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-5.0.1.3006-linux.zip?_gl=1*1njbyph*_gcl_au*MTE4MDYzNDE4LjE3MDQxODU4MTA.*_ga*MjEyMjc5NDA2Ni4xNzA0MTg1ODEw*_ga_9JZ0GZ5TC6*MTcwNDk1NTY2NC42LjEuMTcwNDk2NzY0Mi4xMS4wLjA.
   unzip https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-5.0.1.3006-linux.zip?_gl=1*1njbyph*_gcl_au*MTE4MDYzNDE4LjE3MDQxODU4MTA.
   mv sonar-scanner-4.6.2.2472-linux sonar-scanner


Edit sonar scanner properties and add below line of code.
   vi /opt/sonar-scanner/conf/sonar-scanner.properties


host will be URL of your SonarQube server
   sonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000
   sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
ADD SONARQUBE PUBLIC_IP in LOCALHOST

We need to add the sonar-scanner command to the PATH variable. Letâ€™s create a file to automate the required environment variables configuration
   vi /etc/profile.d/sonar-scanner.sh

Add below line of code in the file:
   #!/bin/bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/opt/sonar-scanner/bin"  

Reboot your computer or use the source command to add the sonar scanner command to the PATH variable.
   reboot
    (or)
   source /etc/profile.d/sonar-scanner.sh

Check the variable set for the scanner with below command:
   env | grep PATH

It will output below list of details:
        PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/opt/sonar-scanner/bin


   sonar-scanner -v

NOW SONAR-SCANNER VERSION is SHOWS


After installation is completed install git maven 
git clone >>>>repo>>>>

NOW USING SONAR-SCANNER WE SCAN OR TEST SOURCE CODE



2) Project Setup and run scanner
   
   Using Command prompt:
Traverse to your project directory for which you want to run scan. In root of the directory run the below command and replace the detail which you have setup and got from the SonarQube project setup. Here replace the projectKey and sonar.login value with your detail

>>>> cd /root/live01/src/main/webapp/ <<<<
 
 
NOW RUN THIS BELOW COMMAND 

   sonar-scanner
   -Dsonar.projectKey=myproject
   -Dsonar.sources=.
   -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000
   -Dsonar.login=b917488b0e13bb34f0ea66d5dd751cd8888d1e4b
project_key mention your maven projectkey name and sources mean our source code and host_url is our sonarqube serverurl and login is sonarqube authentication_token

Once you will run this command, it will automatically create the properties file in the root of the project. So next time you can directly run below command and also update detail in that file.
    sonar-scanner 



this is installation and setup of sonascanner then test reports is submitted to sonarqube
